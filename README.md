# Data-structures

This repo contains Implementation of Data structures which are normally used as a small a prt of algorithms. Because they are very small part of the algorithms, normally Developers or Coders use built-in libraries, which has optimally implemented these data structures. But to understand how they actually get stored & implemented is some what interesting & some times tedious work too, specially in a language like C, where u have only pointer to keep track of the referance. I have tried some of them.
